			<h1>Areas Marching Mountains Helps</h1>
    <h2>Distressed Areas of Appalachia</h2>
    <p>
        The main focus of the network is distressed areas of Appalachia. If the strongest supporters and activists
    in Marching Mountains are within Appalachia, there is no doubt that the network
    can improve band programs in public schools in the distressed areas of Appalachia.
    </p>
    <h2>Appalachia as a whole</h2>
    <p>
        Appalachians know Appalachians. They understand each other best. Many areas of Appalachia
    aren't impoverished and are doing quite well economically.
    </p>
    <p>
        These parts of Appalachia can be the number one source of supporters for the Marching
    Mountains network. They can help their neighbors and help themselves by growing
    from the experiences had within the Marching Mountains network.
    </p>
    <h2>Other Areas</h2>
    <p>
        However, the bigger picture of Marching Mountains includes people from all over
    the country. The network includes people from outside of Appalachia. The network
    thrives by including the advice and perspective of band directors and parents from
    outside of Appalachia. By sharing the strategies and lessons that have proven successful,
    public school band programs in general can benefit.
