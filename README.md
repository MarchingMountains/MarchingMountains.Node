##Marching Mountains' goal 
Our is to create a network to supply public school band programs in distressed areas of Appalachia and Minnesota with donated new and used musical instruments.

##What this project is about
This project is designed to accomplish several things.
  1. Get an instrument in the hands of kids that don't have one to play.
  2. Give developers a chance to contribute their time to something they care about and sharpen their skills at the same time. It feels incredibly meaningful to use awesome technology simply for the benefit of helping a kid you will never meet to have a better life.
  3. Prove that most of us have more time than we realize to make the world a better place.

##What we've already accomplished
We've already provided over 500 years of band to kids in Appalachia and Minnesota. We've given instruments to schools in rural Kentucky and urban Minneapolis. Check out a couple videos of work we've done in the past. http://www.marchingmountains.org/video or read about us on Huffington Post http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/02/post_509_n_704029.html
