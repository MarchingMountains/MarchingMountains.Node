##Marching Mountains' Goal

The organization's goal is to create a network to supply public school band programs in distressed areas of Appalachia and Minnesota with donated new and used musical instruments.
About the Project

##This project is designed to accomplish several things:

1. Get an instrument into the hands of kids that don't have one to play.
2. Give developers, content writers, UX professionals, graphic artists and other professionals a chance to contribute their time to something they care about and sharpen their skills at the same time. It feels incredibly meaningful to use awesome technology simply to help a kid you will never meet have a better life.
3. Prove that most of us have more time than we realize to make the world a better place.

##What We've Already Accomplished

Marching Mountains has already provided more than 500 years of band to kids in Appalachia and Minnesota by donating instruments to schools in rural Kentucky and urban Minneapolis. Check out a couple videos of work we've done in the past: http://www.marchingmountains.org/video or read about us on Huffington Post at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/02/post_509_n_704029.html
Technology Goals

We want this to be a fun project to work on and also one that's valuable for contributor's resumes. We want you to get something else out of it beyond just the meaningfulness of volunteering. The project is primarily built in Node.js and React. Along the way, other fun, new technologies will be used appropriately to solve problems.
