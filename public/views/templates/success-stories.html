            Donating musical instruments has a real and profound effect on the lives of the students
            who receive them. If you have any question about the real impact that donating musical
            instruments has, please read the following success stories from band directors whose
            programs have received instruments through Marching Mountains from potential donors
            like you.

            <em>The Alto saxophone that was donated last year, we put that in the hands of a beginning
                band student who just wasn't able to afford an instrument or even able to afford
                to rent an instrument. We put that in the hands of a student and they have continued
                on with band on alto saxophone, the same alto saxophone. It's worked out so well.
                The student really loves band and are really passionate about it. They are already
                talking about joining the marching band next year in high school and are really
                excited about it. We are thrilled about that. If it had not been for this saxophone
                this kid may not have continued on with band. - Mr. Sean Coughlin, Sheldon Clark</em>

            <em>I have one student who has started with the clarinet for concert season. The other
                will go to a beginning band student at one of my feeder schools. Again I thank you
                and whoever donated the instruments. It is always great to see them placed into
                the hands of excited students. Mr. Jonathan Oates - Webster County High School</em>

                God Bless you. You are changing the lives of Appalachian children one instrument
                at a time. - Ms. Jeanette Oldaker, Harts pk-8 intermediate division</em>

    <h2>Letter from a Band Director About the Effects of Donating Musical Instruments to Marching Mountains</h2>
    <p><img src="/img/quote.gif" />Dear Marching Mountains,</p>

    <p>I just wanted you to know that I'm the band director in West Virginia (of the student who received the instrument from Marching Mountains). I had never heard of your organization until this morning. (The student) started band with her elementary director and so I didn't know what she was talking about when she said she had received an instrument "from a place that gives kids instruments".</p>

    <p>When (the student) said her trumpet was coming in the mail to me, I assumed it was the same program. When I read your letter I sat at my desk and cried for a good half hour.</p>

    <p>I had no idea such a thing even existed. My school is in a fairly poor area as you can imagine. It's not the worst, but it's not the best either. I grew up here. I actually didn't do band all through school because I knew my parents would never be able to afford an instrument. Instead I took piano lessons from a lady a town over who gave lessons for $2 an hour. I ended up falling in love with music and went to college on a full ride scholarship.</p>

    <p>When I got this band job I had no idea what I was going to do with it. I walked into a mouse infested outbuilding that was my classroom with instruments that a former principal had bought at an army surplus auction trying to help the previous band director out. He literally loaded up a dump truck with every instrument he could buy and dumped them out in front of her classroom for her to sort.</p>

    <p>When I got the job, there were still cases that hadn't been opened because there were no keys.</p>

    <p>Long story short, I have a lot of instruments, but most of them are in need of major overhauls or were so smashed and broken that I had to throw them out or use them for parts. I had one poor mellophone that was nearly smashed completely flat...</p>

    <p>But! My band program continues to grow despite all this. We did finally get a new school this past year. My classroom is wonderful and I was so glad to finally get a clean space that had... well... SPACE.</p>

    <p>This year my 7th and 8th grade band is up to 47 and my beginning 6th grade band has 26. I have over half of our middle school students as band members.</p>

    <p>I was doing instrument rentals this week and I kept opening cases and seeing instruments that are going to need to go back to the shop or that I forgot I was keeping for parts. So the last two days I've been trying to figure out what to do about getting some new instruments. Last year I literally had Bandland piece a clarinet together for me out of the parts of 3 instruments so one of my kids could have a working instrument.</p>

    <p>When I got your letter this morning, it was like hope had dawned. lol. I hate to sound so dramatic, but you have no idea how much I've prayed over the last two days for God to show me how to manage this. (Because our 20 something year old uniforms are in desperate need of replacing as well...)</p>

    <p>I know it might be a slow process to get everything I would LIKE to have... but I was so happy to see that there's a way to do it without putting my kids and their families under more financial strain with fundraisers.</p>

    <p>I just wanted to thank you for the organization and let you know that you've made two little girls and one band director extremely happy today. :) (The student) has been asking every day if her instrument had come. she came in first thing this morning to see if it was here and today it was. :)</p>

    <p>Thank you very much. I hope I haven't taken up too much of your time. I just wanted to share this with you.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>(Band Director of a middle school in West Virginia)
